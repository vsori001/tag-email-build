I just wanted to include a note about my code. I ran this email code through Email on Acid with a free trial. I unfortunately couldn't figure out the right combo for Gmail and Outlook.com to get the background color and image to show correctly for the hero (without messing up the other email clients) and ran out of free trial attempts to solve it in time! Given a couple more attempts I know I could have got it going.
